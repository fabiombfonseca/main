### About Me

Results-driven IT leader with over 21 years of experience delivering enterprise data and AI solutions across the private and public sectors. Specializing in scalable data platforms, databases, automation and GenAI enablement, I bring a deep technical background combined with strong business alignment and strategic thinking.

Currently at Dell Technologies, I lead architecture initiatives that power real-time data ingestion and retrieval for analytics, operational intelligence, and AI use cases. My work includes the design and deployment of AI Data-as-a-Service platforms supporting RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), semantic search, and unstructured data access using embeddings and vector databases.

I have broad expertise in SQL and NoSQL databases (Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, Postgres, MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, Teradata, Greenplum) and data engineering tools such as Python, R, Oracle PLSQL, T-SQL, Shell scripts, Ansible, Celonis, StreamSets, MS SQL SSIS, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, and Airflow.

Notable Achievements:
 • 🚀 Launched a data platform used by over 1,000 internal users, improving data availability and platform usability.
 • ⚙️ Implemented CI/CD pipelines for data workflows, reducing manual deployment time by 70% and empowering dev teams with self-service capabilities.
 • 💡 Co-inventor of 2 U.S. patents in intelligent data automation; first Dell IT employee granted a patent, and mentor to interns who achieved the first LATAM Dell IT patents.
 • 🧠 Re-architected a multi-page internal web app into a streamlined single-page app, reducing user clicks by 40% and third-party dev hours by 25%.
 • 💰 Led 100+ DB migrations to open-source/shared clusters, cutting licensing costs by 40%.
 • 🌟 Led Dell’s first Celonis integration with private cloud, migrating 40TB+ from hybrid clusters to AWS-backed infrastructure using S3 + Parquet, enabling secure, scalable access for 200+ global users and powering ML use via a Feature Store architecture. 

I thrive on cross-functional collaboration and have worked closely with product architects, engineering, and operations to align technical execution with business goals. I’m also passionate about mentoring and growing the next generation of data professionals.

Now expanding focus on MLOps, data observability, governance, and vector-native architectures for AI scalability.
